Rails uses strong adherence to MVC, so the code is layed out mostly along those lines.
app/controllers houses the controllers
app/models is where the models live
app/views holds the html.erb templates
app/helpers has code that renders HTML for various controls
lib has modules for utility code
public holds files that will be directly accessible to clients, like images and stylesheets
